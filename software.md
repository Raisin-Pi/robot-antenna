## Software Installation

You'll need to be online to install packages.

First update and upgrade your system. Enter the following commands in to the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Now install Scratch GPIO with the following commands:

```bash
wget http://goo.gl/xzJlz7 -O isgh6.sh
sudo bash isgh6.sh
```

and you'll find the ScratchGPIO icon on the desktop.
