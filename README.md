# Make a Talking Robot

**Introduction**
We are going to make a talking robot using a Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi is a small computer that we can use to create exciting technology. It was created in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help young people like you learn how to code.

This small computer features amazing HD (high-definition) quality video and playback, sports high quality audio and has the ability to play 3D games. 

To get going with your Raspberry Pi, you will need to connect cables and add an SD card before logging in.

## Step 0: 




## Step 1: Lighting the antenna

Letâ€™s get hands on with electronics!  This is where the Raspberry Pi comes in handy. You will program a small light called a LED (Light Emitting Diode) to flash.

You will need a coloured LED, a straightened paper clip (non plastic coasted), a 220 ohm resistor and 4 female to female jumper wires.
